knapsack
- what problem to solve


How does configuration affect the result
- evenly distributed cores
- randomly distributed

How does topology affect the result
- hypercube
- mesh
- array
- circle
- torque


Decide on gpu vs openmpi vs openmp vs hybrid


Question
- does it make sense to compare topology?
- which topology is spartan and can you take advantage of it?



Research question
- mpi vs mp vs hybrid?
	- Hypothesis: mp > hybrid > mpi
- Different algorithms
